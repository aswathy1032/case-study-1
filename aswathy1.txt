Test strategy:
  
1.Assess testability

Operability       -  4
Controllability   -  5
Observability     -  5
Simplicity        -  4
Understandng      -  5
Suitability       -  3
Stability         -  3


2.Assess test factor that must be considered for testing this software 

3 . identify the life cycle stages of this factors in levels of testing:

Correctness               - integration testinng
authorization             - integration testing
continuity of process     - post UAT
access controls           - system testing
Reliabilty                -UAT
Perfomance                -system testing
Integrity                 -system testing



Correctness               - validation , black box testing
authorization             - validation , black box testing
continuity of process     - validation , white box testing 
access controls           - verification , white box testing
Reliabilty                - verification,  white box testing
Perfomance                -validation , black box testing
Integrity                 - verification , white box testing


5 . Assess drivers that would influence testing are:

Correctness             - Individual tester(quality analsyt)
authorization           - Individual tester(quality analsyt)
continuity of process   - client/ management
access controls         -  tester
Reliabilty              -  client/ management
Perfomance              - tester
Integrity               - tester



 Test plan

1. Test item -  DTS


2.Software risk issues -  security, perfomance, testing at the browser platform, browser configuration

Scope:

3 . Feature to be tested  - register user , customer , admin functions,  manager and member functions

4. Feature not to be tested - New version not to be tested

5.Approach -  white box and black box testing

6.Test deliverables - source code , test scenario, test case, test execution report, test report, defect report

7.Pass / Fail criteria - if 5 minor bug and 1 major bug are found with no critical / show stopper, in this case  the application is considered as pass criteria

8.Suspension and resumption criteria - show  stoppers in application, non availabilty of resource / when this is resolved

9.Responsibility - project manager , test leader, tester, client

10.Staffing and training needed - how many testers are required / areas where training is required

11.Schedule - time required to complete the work( 3 weeks)
